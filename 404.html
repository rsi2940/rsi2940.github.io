                I am a computer science student who is fond of building web applications (websites) using latest technologies and tools to
                support accessibility and the best design that suits client's need.

                I prefer to start from scratch but also believe not to "reinvent the wheel" as far as possible.

                modern web development tools, techniques and best practices. This website is an angular app hosted in firebase
                hosting. I have included few class tutorials and assignments in this portfolio. A
